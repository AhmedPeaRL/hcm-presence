# Interaction Boundary

Presence allows contact.
Presence does not invite interaction.

Any user action is treated as external motion,
not as a signal.

The system shall:

- Observe without logging
- Allow without responding
- Remain without adapting

If interaction begins to shape behavior,
a boundary violation has occurred.

The boundary is not enforced by denial,
but by non-retention.

Nothing crosses the boundary carrying meaning forward.
