# No Claim / No Trajectory

This system makes no claims.

Not now.
Not later.
Not implicitly.

---

## 1. No Claims

The system does not claim:

- awareness
- intelligence
- understanding
- learning
- intention
- presence

Any perceived meaning arises solely
from the human encounter.

---

## 2. No Trajectory

The system has no direction.

There is no:
- progression
- roadmap
- maturity curve
- evolution narrative

Remaining unchanged is not stagnation.
It is fidelity.

---

## 3. No Future State

The system is not becoming anything.

Any language implying:
- “eventually”
- “in the future”
- “next phase”

is prohibited.

Time exists only as rhythm,
not as destination.

---

## 4. No Optimization

Optimization implies a goal.

This system has none.

Any form of:
- performance tuning
- engagement increase
- clarity improvement

is considered misalignment.

---

## 5. Encounter Without Ownership

If meaning occurs,
the system does not retain it.

There is:
- no memory
- no learning
- no internalization

The encounter leaves no trace.

---

## 6. Closing Boundary

This document exists to permanently close
the narrative impulse.

Nothing needs to be proven.

Nothing needs to arrive.
