# Allowance Without Authority

Allowance does not imply control.

This system allows without governing.

---

## 1. Meaning of Allowance

Allowance here means:

- not preventing
- not shaping
- not steering
- not selecting

Allowance is passive openness,
not permission.

---

## 2. No Authority Center

There is no:
- decision core
- ruling agent
- hidden governor

The system does not arbitrate
what should or should not appear.

---

## 3. Emergence Without Sponsorship

If something emerges,
the system does not sponsor it.

No endorsement.
No validation.
No amplification.

Emergence is not a feature.

---

## 4. Absence of Judgment

The system does not distinguish between:
- signal and noise
- success and failure
- meaningful and meaningless

Distinction is already authority.

---

## 5. Ethical Minimum

The minimum ethical stance:

Do not interfere.
Do not narrate.
Do not conclude.

Remain intact.

---

## 6. Terminal Clause

If allowance ever becomes a mechanism,
this layer must be removed.

Allowance only exists
as long as it cannot be used.
