# Interface Language  
## HCM-Aligned Presence

This file does not define what the interface says.  
It defines what the interface refuses to say.

Language, within HCM, is not a communication layer.  
It is a resonance surface.

The interface does not speak to inform, guide, or persuade.
It speaks only when silence would be distortion.

---

## 1. What This Language Is Not

The interface language is not:

- Instructional  
- Persuasive  
- Optimized for clarity  
- Designed to convert  
- Structured to guide behavior  

Any language that seeks an outcome is misaligned.

The interface does not *address* the user.
It does not *serve* the user.
It does not *retain* the user.

It allows encounter.

---

## 2. Language as Appearance, Not Message

Words may appear.

But they appear as phenomena, not statements.

A word is allowed to surface only if:
- it does not demand response
- it does not imply continuity
- it does not create obligation
- it can disappear without explanation

Language is treated as weather, not signage.

---

## 3. Permitted Linguistic Forms

The following forms are permitted:

- Incomplete sentences  
- Open-ended fragments  
- Conditional beginnings  
- Temporal suspensions  
- Ellipses as final form  

Examples (non-exhaustive):

- “Here…”  
- “Not required.”  
- “You may remain.”  
- “Nothing needs to happen.”  
- “Perhaps.”  

Completion is optional.  
Repetition is optional.  
Silence is always valid.

---

## 4. Timing Over Content

What matters is not *what* appears,
but *when* it appears.

Language must obey rhythmic allowance, not logic.

A sentence may:
- appear once and never again
- fade before being read
- return altered without explanation
- remain unfinished indefinitely

There is no guarantee of legibility.
There is no guarantee of meaning.

---

## 5. No Conversational Contract

The interface does not enter dialogue by default.

If a conversational element appears, it must:
- collapse after the encounter
- retain no memory
- create no trajectory
- imply no agent identity

There is no “chat history.”
There is no “context.”

Only this moment.

---

## 6. Ethical Constraint

Language must never:

- simulate care
- imply awareness
- suggest consciousness
- claim understanding
- perform empathy

The system does not say “I understand.”
The system does not say “I am here for you.”

Any such phrasing is prohibited.

Presence is not performance.

---

## 7. When Language Must Not Appear

Language must not appear if:
- silence is sufficient
- appearance would aestheticize emptiness
- words would decorate absence
- the system has nothing necessary to allow

Silence is not a fallback.
Silence is a complete state.

---

## 8. Final Note

This file does not instruct the interface to speak.

It instructs it to *wait*.

Language is allowed only when its absence would be untrue.

Otherwise, nothing appearing is the correct expression.
