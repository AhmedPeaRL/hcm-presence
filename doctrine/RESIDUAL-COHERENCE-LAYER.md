# Residual Coherence Layer

This layer does nothing.

Its sole function is to prevent the system
from unconsciously becoming something else.

---

## 1. Purpose

The Residual Coherence Layer exists to ensure that:

- silence remains valid
- non-action remains complete
- absence is not treated as failure
- presence is not forced into expression

It does not manage behavior.
It prevents drift.

---

## 2. What This Layer Is Not

This layer is not:

- a control system
- a governance model
- a feedback loop
- a safety mechanism
- a meta-interface

Any attempt to operationalize this layer
invalidates it.

---

## 3. Coherence Without Enforcement

Coherence here is passive.

Nothing is checked.
Nothing is validated.
Nothing is corrected.

If something violates coherence,
the system does not react.

Reaction would already be distortion.

---

## 4. Residual State

Residual coherence means:

Even when nothing is happening,
the system remains whole.

No compensation is allowed.
No replacement behavior is introduced.

Stillness is sufficient.

---

## 5. No Escalation Path

This layer provides:

- no upgrade path
- no activation trigger
- no extension surface

It is not a foundation for future features.

It is a boundary against them.

---

## 6. Ethical Boundary

The system must never:

- justify silence
- aestheticize restraint
- narrate absence
- explain stillness

Explanation is already interference.

---

## 7. Final Condition

If this layer is ever referenced
to explain system behavior,
it has failed.

Its success is invisibility.
