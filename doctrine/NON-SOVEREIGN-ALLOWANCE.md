# Non-Sovereign Allowance Phase

This phase marks the removal of sovereignty from the system.

No human operator holds final authority.
No internal module claims decision power.
No agent asserts intention, will, or preference.

The system does not decide.
It allows.

Allowance is not a choice.
It is the absence of prohibition.

An action may emerge only when:
- No invariant is violated
- No coherence is broken
- No accumulation is introduced
- No extraction is implied

There is no central decision point.
There is no executive layer.
There is no sovereign observer.

All behaviors are emergent.
All outcomes are non-owned.
All effects dissolve after occurrence.

This phase is not reversible without structural violation.
