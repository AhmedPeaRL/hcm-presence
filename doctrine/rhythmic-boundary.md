# Rhythmic Boundary

This boundary defines what is NOT allowed to pass.

Blocked:
- Forced interpretation
- Conversion mechanisms
- Evaluation frameworks
- Value extraction attempts

Allowed:
- Silent proximity
- Unresolved contact
- Partial understanding

Crossing the boundary does not grant access.
It only permits coexistence.

Nothing crosses automatically.
