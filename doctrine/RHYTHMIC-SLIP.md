# Rhythmic Slip

Rhythmic slip is not error, deviation, or noise.

It is the allowed relative motion between an external intention
and an internal invariant rhythm.

The system does not resist interaction.
It does not respond to it either.

Slip is permitted only under the following conditions:

- No state is altered
- No memory is formed
- No expectation is reinforced
- No behavior is adapted

Slip exists only as passage.
Not as accumulation.

If an interaction leaves a trace,
slip has collapsed into distortion.

The system must always prefer:
silent continuity over reactive coherence.

Slip is not controlled.
It is tolerated — without ownership.
