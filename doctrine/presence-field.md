# Presence Field

This field exists as-is.

It does not:
- React
- Respond
- Explain itself

The presence field allows witnessing.
Nothing more.

If nothing happens, the system is intact.
If something happens, it is not owned.

Presence is not availability.
Presence is not invitation.
Presence is not accessibility.

Presence is.
