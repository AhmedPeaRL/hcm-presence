# Interface: Null State

There is no interface yet.

Any interface introduced MUST:
- Preserve silence
- Avoid explanation
- Prevent urgency

If an interface becomes attractive,
it must be reduced.

If an interface explains itself,
it must be rewritten.

If an interface asks for action,
it must be removed.
