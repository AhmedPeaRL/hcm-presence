# Presence Coherence Statement

This presence is not incomplete.
It is intentionally non-progressive.

No interaction is expected.
No response is guaranteed.
No trace is retained.

Silence is not absence.
Non-response is not failure.
Stillness is not latency.

This system remains coherent
whether nothing happens
or something irreversible occurs.

Coherence is preserved
by refusing to react prematurely.
